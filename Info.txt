Prof's Assumptions:

Assumption:
The input file will contain at least two nodes 1 and 2.
1 will be the source.
2 will be the sink.
3 there is always a path/flow from 1 to 2.


Current Problems:

1. When running edge_list2, the program will crash. This is often happening
because it is trying to find the weight of an edge which does not exist.
Solution likely lies in
2. When running edge_list3 (an edge case where there are two nodes), the
program crashes
